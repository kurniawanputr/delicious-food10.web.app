Shrimp wrapped in bacon and stuffed with Parmesan cheese, basil, and garlic. Be sure and use the large shrimp--the cooking time for the shrimp and the bacon is I did not use BBQ seasoning but instead marinated the shrimp for a few hours in a little hickory brown sugar BBQ sauce just enough to coat the shrimp. Bacon Wrapped Shrimp is the perfect finger food. A great combo of sweet and savory, thanks to the delicious smoky brown sugar rub that and crispy bacon. My husband is an expert at cooking shrimp, he usually makes it in the most amazing garlic sauce, which is so tasty when you dip in some crusty.
