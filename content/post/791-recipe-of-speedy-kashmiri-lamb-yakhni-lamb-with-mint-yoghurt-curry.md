recipeingredient:
- " Lamb prep"
- "500-600 g lamb"
- "3 inch cinnamon stick"
- "3-4 cloves"
- "2 Green cardamom"
- "1 black cardamom"
- "2-3 tsp Fennel Saunf powder"
- "2 tsp salt"
- " Yogurt prep"
- "500-600 g yoghurt"
- "1 tsp Black cardamom powder"
- "4 cloves crushed"
- "5-6 Green cardamoms crushed"
- "1 tsp cinnamon powder"
- "1 tsp cumin zeera powder"
- "Pinch pepper"
- "2 tbsp crushed mint"
- "3-4 strands saffron optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the lamb with all the lamb prep ingredients in a pressure cooker along with a little more than enough water to submerge all meat."
- "Cook the lamb for 10 mins on high flame or until soft. The resulting broth should have a rich smell and taste, and you should be able to see animal fat as well."
- "Whisk the Yoghurt manually or with a mixer to give it a smooth, frothy and consistent texture. Add the saffron strands to it."
- "This is the MOST IMPORTANT STEP. Start heating the Yoghurt on medium high flame and stir continuously for 10 mins or until the Yoghurt starts boiling. If you stop stirring for even a minute, the Yoghurt will start to transform into cheese, and you will ruin the dish. If that happens, throw it away and start over."
- "Filter the boiled meat out to separate from its broth."
- "After the Yoghurt starts boiling, add the pieces of meat along with all spices listed in the Yoghurt prep above. Add 100ml lamb broth from earlier to the mix."
- "Stir occasionally and let it cook on a medium flame for 20 mins. You should be able to see the oil separate and rise to the top from the sides"
- "If the curry gets too thick, keep adding the broth from earlier to thin it and cook for another 5 mins. Repeat if you want a richer taste."
- "The dish is ready!! Serve hot with rice and enjoy! You can add the leftover broth to heat the curry if needed for the next meal."
