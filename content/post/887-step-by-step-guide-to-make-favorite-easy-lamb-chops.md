- "Stir fry the vegetables for the side before you cook the lamb. This time I used bell peppers and maitake mushrooms. Add some olive oil and garlic to a frying pan and when warm, add the rest of the vegetables. Stir fry and season with salt and pepper. Once cooked, transfer to a plate."
- "Add more olive oil, garlic and rosemary to a frying pan and cook on a low heat until fragrant. After that, arrange the lamb in the pan as well and cook both sides on a high heat to lock in the flavours."

You can eat this steak with the middle still rare. Cook it to the degree of doneness that you prefer and then take it off the heat and transfer to a plate. Pour over the sauce that&#39;s left in the frying pan."
