- "2 bottles wine 15L red or white doesnt matter"
- "2 Apples chopped to small chunks"
- "3 oranges"
- "1 lime"
- "1 punnet strawberries"
- "450 ml sprite 14  13 amount of wine"
- "150 ml brandy or cointreau"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut one of the orange into small chunks and reserved the oranges peels (the orange peels are optional). Juiced the other 2 oranges along with the lime. Cut both strawberries and apples into small chunks"
- "Put all the above (step no.1) in a big mixing bowl (I am using jug containers, as I need to be able to transport this in the car without spilling)"
- "Add in wine, brandy and sprite and mix well. It best to let it cool in the fridge for couple of hours (or over night), so the fruits are well marinated with booze."
- "Pour sangria in a fancy glass along with the fruits, and drinks responsibly."
- "My rule of thumb, is to have the ratio of sprite 1/4 - 1/3 of the total wine you used. As for the brandy.. well you can add more if you want to make it stronger (more alcoholic). Apples and oranges are mandatory fruits in sangria (the basic), other type of fruits can be added to your liking. I like to put strawberry in mine as it&#39;s added a nice flavour"
