Spoon the mixture over the green beans. Bacon and sliced almonds bring smokey and crunchy dimension to this traditional green bean casserole recipe. The bacon pieces are supposed to be added to the bowl with the almonds etc. before adding in the green beans. Also the baking time before adding onion on top should be doubled. I used frozen green beans as the fresh ones at the store didn&#39;t look so fresh.
