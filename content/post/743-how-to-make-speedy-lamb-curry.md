recipeinstructions:
- "Marinating Tip: You can usually do this process the previous night so that the spices would enter the lamb or else you could do it 30minutes before you start cooking."
- "For marination:  Wash thoroughly the lamb pieces. Take a bowl and mix ginger, garlic, green chillis, red chilli powder, turmeric powder and the chopped lamb pieces topped with yoghurt. Mix well and let it rest for 30 minutes"
- "For the curry: Please note: you can adjust the amount of oil you would want to use. Pour ghee and oil into a pan and let it heat on medium flame for some minutes. Add asafoetida and after a few seconds add cumin seeds. Let the seeds warm up. The cumin seeds would turn slightly darker than usual colour. Then add curry leaves, cloves, cardamom pods and cinnamon stick. Stir and let it heat until the curry leaves change color slightly."
- "Add garlic and stir. You should let it fry until you smell it. Don&#39;t overcook it as it will turn color and spoil the flavor. Add to this ginger, green chillies and the sliced onions. Saute until the onions become transparent or soften."
- "Once the onions soften, add the lamb pieces that was marinated. Do not add the yoghurt mix yet. Ideally you might not need to add water since lamb would release some but if you want you can add a little bit. Cover the pan and let it boil for 20-30 minutes until about 85% is cooked. Stir the mix in between if needed."
- "While you wait for the lamb to boil. You could prepare the masala mix. In a bowl add all the masala ingredients mentioned, turmeric powder, red chilli powder and coriander-cumin powder. Mix well. Ideally Kashmiri chili powder is used for the color and also for the spicy flavor. But you can use whichever red chilli powder you have."
- "Add the crushed tomatoes to the pan after the lamb appears to be cooked. Pour in the yoghurt mix used for marination. Mix well and then add in the masala mix prepared above. Add the lamb cubes, though this is optional. Add salt as per taste and let it cook for another 20 minutes until oil separates from the spices."
- "Add in coriander leaves and mix and let it cook for another 5-10 minutes. Serve hot and enjoy ðŸ˜‹."
