recipeinstructions:
- "Fry the bacon in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat until crispy. Remove from pan, chop and set aside."
- "In the same pan, turn temperature to medium-high to high heat, melt the butter. Add the mushrooms, drizzle with oil and mix through, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.

- "Pour in the cream and spices. Reduce heat down to low. Gently simmer until tender (approximately 5 minutes) and sauce is slightly thickened."
