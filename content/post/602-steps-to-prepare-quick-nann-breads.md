- "250 g plain flour"
- "3 tsp fine sugar"
- "1 tsp instant dry yeast"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "3 tbsp plain yogurt"

recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the flour, sugar, yeast and salt in a bowl. And in a separate bowl, whisk the oil, yogurt and warm water together."
- "Mix the wet ingredients into the dry ones using a fork and combine. Just before the mixture comes together, dust your hands with lots of flour and knead the dough gently in the bowl (it should be sticky but if it’s too sticky to handle, add a bit more flour)."
- "Lightly oil another bowl (big enough for the dough x2). Transfer the dough to bowl. Cover and place in a warm place for 90 minutes."
- "Once the dough has doubled in size, transfer it onto a well floured surface. Roll into a long rectangle and cut into 6 pieces."
- "Heat a large frying pan or skillet over a high heat. Turn on the oven to keep the cooked bread warm and melt a couple of tbsps for brushing the cooked bread."
- "Roll each piece into a thin, oval shape, shake off the excess flour and transfer onto the hot pan."
- "Cook until bubbles start to appear on one side. Then flip and cook until brown/black blisters start to form (about 90-120secs). Then brush both sides with melted butter. Place in the oven to keep warm and repeat with the remaining dough."
