- " Salt and Pepper a good pinch"
- "2 tbsp. fresh roughly chopped corriander"
recipeinstructions:
- "First of all put the diced lamb in a large bowl, pour over the lemon juice and mix in the salt, pepper and garam masala. Leave to marinate for as long as possible preferably over night (although I only had an hour and it was still delicious)."
- "Whilst the lamb pieces are marinating prepare the spices and vegetables. Once ready, get a large frying pan and heat on a medium to high heat and add the spices to heat through, this only takes a minute or two. Its important to keep an eye on this part as you don’t want them to burn.  Add the oil or low fat oil spray throw in the lamb and onions."

- "Throw in the tinned tomatoes, add the chilli, give it a good stir so it thickens through, then dash in the cup of water. Now be patient, let it simmer, it depends on how tender the shoulder is, mine did take an hour on the hob!, It can take less time it just depends.  Keep checking every 10 minutes or so, add more water if it looks like it its too thick and sticking. I decided to let it cook through for another 30 minutes which gave it this deep brown colour.  I know the pan is messy!"
- "Enjoy serve with basmati rice, dips and naan bread!"
