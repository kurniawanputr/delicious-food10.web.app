recipeingredient:
- "500 g unbleached flower"
- "375 g hot water"
- "10 g kosher salt"
- "8 g dry active yeast"
- "200 g cheddar shredded"
- "200 g cheddar cubed"
recipeinstructions:
- "Measure flour, water, salt, and yeast ahead of time. MAKE SURE YOUR WATER IS A GOOD TEMPERATURE AS WELL. This is done relative to the temperature of your flour. The formula I use is 220-(flour temp*2). For example, my flour was about 60°F so my water needs to be about 100°F (220-(120)=100)."
- "Dump the yeast into the water and swish it around with your finger until bubble start to form, then let it sit for a few minutes."
- "Sift the flour over the mixture, followed by the salt. It is important to have the flour as a buffer because the salt will kill the yeast if added directly."
- "Mix thoroughly until the mixture forms an unbearably sticky dough and let sit for 25 minutes."
- "Fold the dough in on itself a few times. It should become tighter, firmer, and slightly less sticky. It helps to flour you hands and the dough for this."
- "Cover the dough and let prove for 1.5 hours. To get a good rise, put it somewhere warm like in front of a heater or fireplace. When you come back to it, it should be roughly twice the size."
- "Repeat step 5 while adding cheese in each fold. This should add significant bulk to your bread."
- "Transfer the dough into a pan or pans. I split it between two 9in*5in pans (sprayed with oil), but you can put it in one big one, or into a pre heated dutch oven. Then you will prove for another 1.5 hours."
- "Bake at 425°F. The time will be different depending on what it&#39;s baked in. For me it was about 25 minutes. Check after about 10 usually and cover with aluminum foil if the top starts to brown too fast. Transfer loaf(s) to a cooling rack and let cool for a few minutes. The cheese on the sides may stick to the pan if it wasn&#39;t greased well."
